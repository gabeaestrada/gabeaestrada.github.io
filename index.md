### CPSC 120

*Lab 10 Reflection (Counties & Population Percentages)
 Lab 10 ended up being one of my favorites because it finally made sense how vectors of vectors actually work when you use them in a real program. I liked watching it search for a county and then show what percentage of the state it makes up, because it felt way more practical than most assignments. The formatting part with std::fixed and setprecision() also made everything look cleaner, which honestly made the program feel nicer to use. I also learned a lot about command-line arguments and how the program reacts when someone types the county name wrong, which was kind of cool to see actually working.


*Lab 9 Reflection (Spell Checker Program)
Lab 9 was enjoyable because it made me feel like I was building a tiny version of a real spell-checker. Reading words from a dictionary file and comparing them to another document was straightforward but still interesting. I liked seeing the list of misspelled words appear, because it showed that my functions and loops were finally working correctly. This lab made me more confident with file reading, vectors, and breaking a problem into small steps.

*Lab 7 Reflection (Parking Rules Program)
I liked Lab 7 because it forced me to pay close attention to details instead of just writing code quickly. Checking every part of the input—street, day, hour, and minute—made the program feel more complete and organized. It was also fun to figure out how each street had its own parking rules and which function to call for each one. This lab definitely helped me get better at writing clear conditionals and making sure the program doesn’t accept anything it shouldn’t.
